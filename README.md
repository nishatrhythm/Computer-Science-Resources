# 💻 Computer Science Resources  
### My Bachelor’s Journey, Unpacked for You  

Hey there! I’m Nishat Mahmud, and welcome to **Computer Science Resources** — a growing digital scrapbook of my Computer Science bachelor’s degree, now bursting with slides, books, and exam questions! This repo is my heart on a screen: the late nights, the “aha!” moments, and the caffeine-fueled breakthroughs that carried me through. It’s all here on [GitHub](https://github.com/nishatrhythm/Computer-Science-Resources) because these resources — slides, books, and questions — deserve to live beyond my laptop and help you too!

## 🌟 What’s Inside?  
This repo is packed with goodies from my CS journey — 23 slide topics, a book collection, and now every exam question I faced. Here’s the full scoop:  
- **Algorithm** - The art of solving problems, one step at a time.  
- **Artificial Intelligence** - Where machines start thinking (almost) like us.  
- **Cloud Computing** - The magic of the internet’s invisible backbone.  
- **Compiler Design and Construction** - Turning code into something computers get.  
- **Computer Architecture** - The nuts and bolts of what’s under the hood.  
- **Computer Graphics and Animation** - Making pixels dance and stories pop.  
- **Computer Networks** - How the world stays connected.  
- **DBMS** - Databases, the unsung heroes of organized chaos.  
- **Data Communication** - Bits and bytes on the move.  
- **Data Mining and Data Warehousing** - Digging gold from mountains of data.  
- **Data Science** - Numbers, patterns, and a little bit of wizardry.  
- **Digital Image Processing** - Teaching computers to see the world.  
- **Digital Signal Processing** - The science behind sound and signals.  
- **Discrete Mathematics** - The quiet foundation of all things CS.  
- **Internet and Web Programming** - Building the web, one line at a time.  
- **Mathematical Analysis** - Where math meets code and sparks fly.  
- **Microprocessor and Assembly Language** - Talking to machines in their own tongue.  
- **Numerical Analysis** - Crunching numbers with precision.  
- **Object Oriented Programming-1 (C++)** - Objects, classes, and a new way to think.  
- **Object Oriented Programming-2 (Java)** - More OOP goodness, Java-style.  
- **Operating Systems** - The maestros keeping our systems in tune.  
- **Software Engineering** - Building stuff that lasts (and works!).  
- **Theory of Computation** - The big ideas behind what computers *can* do.  
- **All Books** - A treasure chest of CS texts I leaned on, now yours to explore!  
- **All Questions** - Every exam question from my BSc life, from brain-benders to triumphs!  

The slides are my notes and lessons, the books were my lifelines, and the questions? They’re the battles I fought — all here for you to conquer too.

## 💡 Why This Exists  
Back in my student days, I’d stare at these slides, flip through those books, and wrestle with exam questions, thinking, “This is too good to keep to myself.” They shaped me — from algorithms that twisted my brain to questions that tested my grit. So, I’m sharing it all — slides, books, and now every question I faced — no gates, no fees, just open access. Whether you’re studying, teaching, or just curious, I hope this stash lights a spark for you like it did for me.

## 🌼 A Quick Note from Me  
Putting this together feels like handing you a piece of my journey. I remember poring over these slides, leaning on those books, and sweating through those exam questions — sometimes lost, sometimes thrilled, always learning. Uploading them here, all in one big “initial commit” burst (plus books and questions as extra gifts), is my way of saying, “Hey, we’re in this together.” If they help even one person untangle a concept, ace a test, or just feel less alone, I’ll call it a win.  

## 🤝 Let’s Build Something Together  
Got your own slides, books, or questions to add? Found a cool way to use these? I’d love to hear from you:  
- Drop a **star** if this hits the spot.  
- Share your thoughts in an issue or pull request.  
- Fork it and add your own flavor!  
Let’s keep the CS community buzzing, one slide, page, or question at a time.
